# Job Offer Factory Autorun

Job Offer Factory Autorun is an endâ€‘toâ€‘end job search automation pipeline.  Built by Alex Minnick, it turns cumbersome applications into a repeatable, operatorâ€‘friendly workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

* **Parses job descriptions** to extract keywords, skills and requirements.
* **Generates tailored materials** â€“ resumes, cover letters and outreach messages customised to each role.
* **Scores your fit** and highlights where you meet or exceed requirements.
* **Logs every application** into a tracker (`applications.json`) and produces an action dashboard so you never lose track.
* **Drafts LinkedIn posts and About sections** to optimise your online presence.

## ðŸ›  Architecture

The pipeline is written in Python and orchestrated via modular functions:

1. **Input parser** â€“ ingests job descriptions and tokenises them into required and preferred skills.
2. **Resume generator** â€“ assembles your master resume into a customised version that emphasises relevant experience.
3. **Cover letter writer** â€“ crafts concise, persuasive letters referencing the companyâ€™s mission and your projects.
4. **Outreach DM creator** â€“ produces short, humanâ€‘sounding messages for recruiters or hiring managers.
5. **Tracker & dashboard** â€“ logs each application with status and followâ€‘up dates and outputs a Markdown dashboard summarising your search.

## âœ… Why Use It

Applying manually wastes hours and leads to generic applications.  Job Offer Factory Autorun scales your effort: send highâ€‘quality, customised applications to multiple roles in minutes while retaining the human touch.  Check the generated files, make any tweaks, then submit.  Itâ€™s like having a personal assistant for your job hunt.
