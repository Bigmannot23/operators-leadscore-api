### Proof‑of‑ROI
- **Improved qualification:** Early adopters saw higher conversion by focusing on leads with high scores.
- **Fast experimentation:** New scoring models can be deployed within minutes for A/B testing.
- **Secure access:** Uses API keys and authentication to protect your data.

### What it does
- **Endpoint `/score`:** Accepts lead information (name, company, etc.) and returns a score between 0 and 100.
- **API key management:** Request a key and include it in the `x-api-key` header to authenticate.
- **Integration ready:** Designed to plug into your CRM or other systems; returns JSON responses.
- **Customization:** Swap out the scoring logic for your own model or heuristics.

### Why it matters
Prioritizing leads manually is error‑prone. This API helps sales operators focus on the highest‑value prospects, increasing conversion rates and saving time.

### Quickstart
1. Clone this repo and install dependencies.
2. Run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn.
3. Request an API key via the provided script or admin endpoint.
